py2exe for Python 3
===================

`py2exe` is a distutils extension which allows to build standalone
Windows executable programs (32-bit and 64-bit) from Python scripts.
It can build console executables, windows (GUI) executables, windows
services, and DLL/EXE COM servers.

This is an attempt to keep using py2exe with Python 3.5 and modern modules.

For further information see [the original README](README_ORIGINAL.rst).
